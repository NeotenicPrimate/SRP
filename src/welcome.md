Societal model where essential goods and services are guaranteed to every citizen, managed through a democratic process, and are produced sustainably and transparently with the help of automation.

# Public

**Publicly Owned**: This means the infrastructure, production facilities, and resources are owned collectively by the society. This eliminates profit motives from the equation and ensures that the focus remains on serving the public good.

# Democratic

**Democratically Governed/Controlled**: Citizens have a say in what is produced and how. This could be done through voting, consensus, or other democratic processes.

# Sustainable

**Quantify/Measure Externalities**: Accounting for all the environmental, social, and economic impacts of production. This ensures that the true costs (including environmental degradation, social disruptions, etc.) are factored into decisions.

# Automated

**Fully Automated**: Most, if not all, of the production processes are carried out by machines, robots, or AI. This ensures efficiency and can free humans from laborious tasks.

# Transparent

**Fully Transparent Flows**: All processes, from raw material extraction to end product distribution, are transparent. This includes the flow of materials, finances, and labor.
